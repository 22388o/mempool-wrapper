# Mempool.space 

Please visit your Mempool Tor address in a Tor Browser in order to use this service.
## Configuration

Mempool on the Embassy requires a full archival Bitcoin node to function.

Your Mempool can be configured to use your Embassy Bitcoin Core node, or an external node. Many settings are considered _advanced_ and should be used with caution. For the vast majority of users and use-cases, we recommend using the defaults. You can change nodes from the `Config` menu at any time. Once configured, you can open your favorite tor browser to see the Bitcoin mempool!

## Notes

If you select to use your internal node, mempool data displayed is obtained from your Bitcoin full node.
