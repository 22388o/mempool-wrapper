# Mempool.space 

Mempool is an open-source explorer developed for the Bitcoin community, focusing on the emerging transaction fee market to help our transition into a multi-layer ecosystem. 
## Configuration

Mempool on the Embassy requires a fully synced archival Bitcoin Core node to function.

This implementation of Mempool on Embassy enables you to connect to your own internal Bitcoin Core node, or any external Bitcoin Core node using RPC credentials. 
For the vast majority of users and use-cases, we recommend using the defaults. You can change nodes from the `Config` menu at any time. Once configured, you can open your favorite browser to see the Bitcoin mempool!

## Notes

If you select to use your Internal Bitcoin Proxy, mempool data displayed is obtained from your Bitcoin full node.
